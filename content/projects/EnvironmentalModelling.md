This project saw the creation of many climate models in Python to predict future climate patterns by modelling the Earth's atmosphere, emissions, solar radiation, energy forcings and feedbacks. This project explored the sensitivity of the climate to different forcings and feedbacks, and the implications of these changes on the Earth's climate.
