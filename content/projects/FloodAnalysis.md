I built a river flooding model to then apply advanced statistical methods to analyse flood patterns. A risk and damage assessment was undertaken to identify the most vulnerable areas and to develop a flood management plan. Finally, extreme value analysis was used to predict future flood events and to develop a flood warning system.
