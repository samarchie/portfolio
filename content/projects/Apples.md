Developed machine learning models trained on historical measurements of fruit diameters to forecast the growth over time and predict the final harvest diameter. These models showed over 99% accuracy when predicting 4 months into the future. The models were critical to allowing growers to plan their harvests more efficiently, reduce waste and plan their sales & marketing campaigns accordingly.
