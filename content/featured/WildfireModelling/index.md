Extracted and manipulated live datasets of weather data across Aotearoa New Zealand from local stations. When coupled with historical weather datasets, I predicted where wildfires have the highest probability of occurring, given the current weather. For this course, my skills in manipulating large datasets, especially in the NetCDF format, were put to the test.
