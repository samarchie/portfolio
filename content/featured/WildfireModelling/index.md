What if we could predict wildfires before they happen using live weather data?

In this project, I extracted and manipulated historical and live weather data from local weather stations across Aotearoa New Zealand to calculate the Fire Weather Index (FWI). By processing terabytes of climate data, I developed a tool that could revolutionise fire prevention strategies, showcasing the power of data science in environmental protection.
