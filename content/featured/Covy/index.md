<!-- Like most people during the second wave of the pandemic, I didn't appreciate the gruesome and sad realities shown in the media. -->

<!-- I built a data scraping bot to summarise how quickly cases were rising in Aotearoa New Zealand, and more importantly, keep track of known locations of interest in my city and University. In less than 10 minutes of the Ministry of Health or the University of Canterbury updating their websites, I would receive a notification on my phone. -->

During the pandemic's second wave, I developed a data scraping bot to provide timely, localised COVID-19 updates. This tool:

<ul>
<li>Summarised case growth rates in New Zealand</li>
<li>Tracked locations of interest in my city and university</li>
<li>Delivered notifications within 10 minutes of official updates</li>
</ul>

This project demonstrates my ability to create practical, data-driven solutions that address urgent public health needs while showcasing skills in web scraping, data analysis, and mobile notifications.
